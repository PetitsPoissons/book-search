# Book Search Engine ![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This simple Google Books API search engine allows users to search for books and save/remove them to/from their accounts. Originally built with a RESTful API, the app was refactored to be a GraphQL API. The app was built using the MERN stack, with an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, and an Apollo Provider to communicate with the Apollo Server.
